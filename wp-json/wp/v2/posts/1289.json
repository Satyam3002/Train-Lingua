It\u2019s hard. And it\u2019s usually so uneven. You can end in failure. But life is a journey, not a marathon, so you always have another opportunity to restart and improve.<\/p>\n<p id=\"e925\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Many people practically look out for secrets, tricks, and hacks that will make EVERYTHING better right now. But unfortunately life doesn\u2019t work that way. There are no \u201covernight successes\u201d. Think of all the incredible people you truly admire. They didn\u2019t succeed becasue of one giant move, but rather a series of small and consistent actions over time.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"034d\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Stop aiming for radical personal&nbsp;change!<\/h3>\n<p id=\"5d95\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--h3\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">\u201cBe patient with yourself.

You\u2019ve got to embrace the process and enjoy it. You can\u2019t escape the hard work it takes to get better. Every incredibly successful person you know today has been through the boring, mundane, time-tested process that eventually brings success. So, stop looking for \u201cquick hacks\u201d that bring faster results.<\/p>\n<p id=\"8ae3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Instead of reading every self-improvement post for the one golden tip that will make you superhumanly efficient, focus on doing the actual work that needs to be done. You can inspire yourself to take action. The hard, long process is the only way though. You can\u2019t achieve tremendous life success with a quick fix. Nobody gets it that easy.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/the-mission\/get-1-better-every-day-the-kaizen-approach-to-self-improvement-b79c9e045678\">Original Article<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u201cCompounding is the greatest mathematical discovery of all time.\u201d \u2014 Albert Einstein The quest to become a better version of yourself often feels like a roller coaster ride.
