										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Are you new to PHP or need a refresher?</strong> Then this course will help you get all the fundamentals of Procedural PHP, Object Oriented PHP, MYSQLi and ending the course by building a CMS system similar to WordPress, Joomla or Drupal.<br />
<strong>Knowing PHP has allowed me to make enough money to stay home and make courses like this one for students all over the world.</strong> Being a PHP developer can allow anyone to make really good money online and offline, developing dynamic applications.<br />
Knowing <strong>PHP </strong>will allow you to build web applications, websites or Content Management systems, like WordPress, Facebook, Twitter or even Google.<br />
<strong>There is no limit to what you can do with this knowledge.</strong> PHP is one of the most important web programming languages to learn, and knowing it, will give you <strong>SUPER POWERS</strong> in the web development world and job market place.<br />
<strong>Why?</strong><br />
Because Millions of websites and applications (the majority) use PHP. You can find a job anywhere or even work on your own, online and in places like freelancer or Odesk. You can definitely make a substantial income once you learn it.<br />
<strong>I will not bore you :)</strong><br />
I take my courses very seriously but at the same time I try to make it fun since I know how difficult learning from an instructor with a monotone voice or boring attitude is. This course is fun, and when you need some energy to keep going, you will get it from me.<br />
<strong>My Approach</strong><br />
Practice, practice and more practice. Every section inside this course has a practice lecture at the end, reinforcing everything with went over in the lectures.
